      <h2>For Users</h2>
      <p>
        We have developed a unique shopping experience that goes far beyond traditional online shops. With the ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) app, you can easily scan your own living space using your smartphone and transfer it into a virtual environment. You then have the opportunity to choose from a wide variety of 3D furniture models and place them in your digitally created room.
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows you to experience firsthand, even before purchasing, how the selected furniture fits into your home, the impact it creates in your personal space, and how it appears under different lighting conditions. This immersive experience enables you to test design ideas, try out various combinations, and ultimately make an informed purchase decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our user-friendly interface guides you step by step through the entire process – from room measurement to final product placement – and also provides detailed product information, customer reviews, and interactive features that personalize your shopping experience. By seamlessly integrating virtual reality into the purchasing process, we reduce uncertainties, minimize mis-purchases, and create an engaging, forward-thinking shopping experience.
