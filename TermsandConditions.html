    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <section id="terms">
        <h2>1. Scope</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Applicability:</strong> These Terms and Conditions apply to all users (sellers and buyers) of the "ScanShape" Platform (hereinafter referred to as the “Platform”). By using the Platform, all users accept these Terms and Conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Contracting Parties</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Platform Operator:</strong> ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt)<br>
            <strong>Address:</strong> Marienstr. 21, 97332 Volkach, Germany<br>
            <strong>Tel:</strong> +49 151 700 35 77 1<br>
            <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:lukasgroetsch94@gmail.com">lukasgroetsch94@gmail.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Users:</strong> Sellers (merchants) and buyers who register via the Platform and use its services.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Role and Function of the Platform</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Pure Mediation Function:</strong> The Platform merely provides a technical infrastructure that enables sellers to offer their goods and buyers to find them and initiate the purchasing process.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> The Platform does not intervene in the actual sales process (payment processing, shipping, invoicing) – these tasks are solely the responsibility of the sellers or their appointed service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No VAT Supply Arrangement:</strong> ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) does not assume any tax-related supply arrangement, as all contracts, invoicing, and processing of goods delivery are executed directly between the seller and the buyer or their service providers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> When a product is offered on the Platform, the buyer initiates the purchase – the entire payment flow takes place directly between the buyer and the respective seller (or through an external payment service provider). ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) only receives a mediation fee without having to interfere in the payment process.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Registration and Use of the Platform</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>User Account:</strong> Registration is required for the use of the Platform. The information provided by the user (especially by sellers) must be complete, accurate, and up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Conclusion of Contract:</strong> The contract between ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) and the user is concluded upon registration and acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payment Processing and Mediation Fee</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Payments between buyers and sellers are processed directly via payment service providers chosen by the sellers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe). ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) is not involved in the payment flow.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Mediation Fee:</strong> ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) receives a contractually agreed mediation fee, which is predetermined by the sellers and regulated separately in the Terms of Use. This fee is processed automatically via the respective payment service provider without ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) intervening in the payment process.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Duties of the Sellers</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> Sellers are solely responsible for complying with all legal requirements, particularly in the areas of VAT, product liability, consumer protection, and other relevant laws.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Product Offerings and Processing:</strong> All listings on the Platform must accurately represent the actual products and comply with legal standards. Shipping, invoicing, and payment processing are exclusively handled by the seller or their appointed service providers.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Liability and Warranty</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> As a mediator, ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) is only liable for damages resulting from gross negligence or intentional misconduct. ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) assumes no liability for the content and services provided by the sellers.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>No Warranty for Sales Processes:</strong> Since ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) does not intervene in the sales process, the Platform operator does not provide any warranty or guarantee for payment processing, delivery, or the quality of the sold goods.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Data Protection Principles:</strong> ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) is committed to protecting the personal data of users in accordance with applicable data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR). A detailed privacy policy will be provided separately.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Final Provisions</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Amendment of Terms and Conditions:</strong> ScanShape UG (haftungsbeschränkt) reserves the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time. Users will be informed of significant changes in a timely manner.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law:</strong> For all disputes arising from or in connection with these Terms and Conditions, the law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall apply. The jurisdiction shall be the District Court of Kitzingen, insofar as legally permissible.
